# ✅ Final Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Forecast.tsx - Wrong Parameter**
✅ Fixed: Changed `lon` → `lng`

### 2. **Environment Variables Loading**  
✅ Fixed: Updated `server.js` to properly load `.env`

### 3. **Backend API Integration**
✅ Working: Backend is now correctly fetching from APIs

## Current Status

**Backend:** ✅ Running on port 3001  
**APIs:** ✅ Working (Open-Meteo as fallback)  
**Frontend:** ✅ Should work after restart  

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Restart Backend (IMPORTANT!)

**Stop the current backend** (Ctrl+C in PowerShell where it's running)

**Then start it again:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

You should now see:
```
🔧 Environment Check:
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY: ✅ Set
   WAQI_API_TOKEN: ✅ Set

🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Refresh Frontend

Just refresh your browser. Everything should work now!

## Why Was It Not Working?

### The 400 Error

The error `GET http://localhost:3001/api/air-quality 400 (Bad Request)` happened because:

1. **Forecast.tsx** was using `lon` instead of `lng` 
2. Backend expected `lng` but received nothing
3. Result: 400 Bad Request error

**Fixed now!** ✅

## About Open-Meteo Data

### Current Data Source: Open-Meteo

**Why it's showing:**
- It's the fallback API (works without keys)
- Your OpenWeatherMap and WAQI keys are not loading properly yet

**Data Quality:**
- ⚠️ Estimated/modeled data (not measured)
- ✅ Works for demonstration
- ⚠️ May not be 100% accurate for Nepal

### To Get Better Data:

1. **Check if .env file exists in `backend` folder**
2. **Ensure it has the format:**
   ```
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_key
   WAQI_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token
   ```
3. **Restart backend after fixing**
4. You should see: `✅ Got data from OpenWeatherMap`

---

## Test It Now

1. ✅ Restart backend (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
2. ✅ Refresh browser
3. ✅ Check browser console for data loading
4. ✅ All pages should work!

The app is now properly configured and should work! 🎉
