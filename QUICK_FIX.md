## About Open-Meteo Data

**Why the data might seem "incorrect":**

1. **Open-Meteo uses modeling**
   - Nepal has limited monitoring stations
   - Data is estimated using weather models
   - Not 100% accurate for rural areas

2. **Solution: Add API keys**

Create `backend/.env` file:

```env
PORT=3001
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
WAQI_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

### How to Get API Keys:

**OpenWeatherMap (Recommended):**
1. Go to: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Sign up for free
3. Get API key
4. Add to `.env`

**WAQI (Optional):**
1. Go to: https://aqicn.org/api/
2. Sign up for free
3. Get token
4. Add to `.env`

Then restart backend.
