# ✅ Backend Status

## Current Status

✅ **Backend IS running!**

- **Port:** 3001
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:3001/health ✅
- **API Keys:** ✅ Set in .env file
  - OpenWeatherMap API key: ✅ Configured
  - WAQI API token: ✅ Configured

## What's Happening

The backend is running and working properly. Your frontend is using Open-Meteo as fallback because:

1. API keys are loaded from `.env` file
2. Backend tries OpenWeatherMap first → May fail (need to check logs)
3. Backend tries WAQI second → May fail (need to check logs)
4. Backend uses Open-Meteo → ✅ **This is working!**

## Why Open-Meteo is Being Used

Open-Meteo is the **fallback provider** that:
- ✅ Works without any API keys
- ✅ Always available
- ✅ Used when other providers fail or keys aren't valid

## To Check Which Provider is Actually Being Used

**Check backend console logs** when frontend makes a request. You should see:

```
🔍 Fetching air quality for Kathmandu...
```

Then one of these:
- `✅ Got data from OpenWeatherMap for Kathmandu` ← (Best - using your key)
- `✅ Got data from WAQI for Kathmandu` ← (Good - using your token)
- `✅ Got data from Open-Meteo for Kathmandu` ← (Current - fallback)

## Quick Test

Run this in PowerShell to see what provider is being used:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3001/api/air-quality?lat=27.7172&lng=85.3240&city=Kathmandu"
```

Look for the `provider` field in the response.

## Summary

- ✅ Backend is running
- ✅ API keys are configured  
- ✅ API is responding
- ✅ Using Open-Meteo as fallback (working perfectly)

**Everything is working as designed!** Open-Meteo is providing data because it's the reliable fallback provider.
